    <h2>The Recipe</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This healthy lasagna recipe is a lighter variation of a traditional lasagna recipe. 
        It uses Stonyfield Organic Greek Yogurt instead of the typical ricotta cheese and packs a punch in the flavor department. 
        Every bite captures each component of the dish; the homemade beef marinara sauce paired with the creamy yogurt filling and 
        gooey cheese topping will have everyone at the dinner table asking for seconds!
